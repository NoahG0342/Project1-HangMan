# Project1-HangMan :

Hangman is a game where a player is showen a blank answer feild that contains a hidden word. They then have to find that word by guessing letters once at a time. The player has up to 6 wrong guesses before they then lose all there lives. If the player guesses all the letters or figures out the word before they run out with lives then they win.

# The breakdown of what i did :

1. I made a wire frame to have a starting point for what i feel like it would be somewhere around the look of it

2. Next there is this great website called trello that i love so much and i used that to help me stay on track and write out cards so i know what has been done what needs to be done and what i am working on at that moment

3. Touched my index.html and started working on that by adding my boilerplate and this is where i put the container for my answer and all the divs for my key board 

4. Touched my main.css and this is where i do all of my styling 

5. Made some varables to use in the functions that i create 

 6. I made the buttons with a on click function for my keyboard so that each time you click on a letter it will go through the array and see if the word is in the the answer array

# What i would like to see happen in my project that i didnt have the chance to get to this go around :

There are a few things on this project that i would like to have seen that i just didnt get to see like:

- Playing with the styling a little more to make the app look a little nicer

- Add some more words to be used in the game so it isn't so repetative 

- I would also like to have been able to add a hint button 

- Lastly the thng that i would like to have done the most is had the win and lose function this is the most important thing that i didn't get to achieve

# What i used

- Html
- Css 
- JavaScript
