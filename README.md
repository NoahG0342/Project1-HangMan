# What i would like to see happen in my project that i didnt have the chance to get to this go around :

There are a few things on this project that i would like to have seen that i just didnt get to see like:

- Playing with the styling a little more to make the app look a little nicer

- Add some more words to be used in the game so it isn't so repetative 

- I would also like to have been able to add a hint button 

- Lastly the thng that i would like to have done the most is had the win and lose function this is the most important thing that i didn't get to achieve

# What i used

- Html
- Css 
- JavaScript
